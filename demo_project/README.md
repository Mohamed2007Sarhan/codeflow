
# Demo Project for Code Analysis and Debugging Visualizer

This project demonstrates the capabilities of the enhanced debugging visualizer.

## Files Included

1. **main.py** - Entry point demonstrating cross-module function calls
2. **utils.py** - Utility functions with error conditions
3. **models.py** - Class definitions
4. **complex.py** - Advanced Python constructs (recursion, classes, math)

## Features Demonstrated

- Multi-file project debugging
- Cross-module function calls
- Class instantiation and method calls
- Error conditions (ZeroDivisionError, NameError)
- Recursive functions
- Loop constructs
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling

## How to Use with the Debugger

1. Open the project folder in the Code Analysis and Debugging Visualizer
2. Select any file to debug from the file selector
3. Run analysis to see code structure
4. Step through execution with visual feedback
5. Observe:
   - Green lines: Successfully executed
   - Red lines: Errors detected
   - Blue line: Currently executing
   - Timeline indicators: [SUCCESS] (success), [ERROR] (error), [PENDING] (pending), [CURRENT] (current)
6. Switch between files using the file selector
7. View execution flow graph in the Flow Graph tab
